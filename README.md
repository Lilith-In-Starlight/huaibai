# Huaıbaı

A [Toaq](https://toaq.net/) translation of Minecraft.

This resource pack requires the mod [Caxton](https://modrinth.com/mod/caxton) for displaying Derani text. If you're not used to installing mods, don't worry: [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) makes this pretty easy.

## Installation with Prism Launcher

If you don't already have a Minecraft instance in your Prism Launcher, add a new one with completely vanilla settings.

Right click on the instance and press 'Edit'. In the sidebar of the Version tab, press 'Install Fabric'. This will be your mod loader.

Next, switch to the Mods tab and press the 'Download mods' button. In the pop-up, under Modrinth, search for Caxton, select it with the 'Select mod for download' button, search for Fabric API, select it as well, and finally press 'Review and confirm'.

You can now launch the game. Once you're in, go to the Options > Resource Packs menu and drag and drop the [Huaıbaı.zip resource pack](https://github.com/toaq/huaibai/releases/download/latest/Huaıbaı.zip) into the list, making sure to select it. Caxton might crash the game at this point—just relaunch it if this happens.

Finally, select Toaq from the language menu. (Hint: It's between Portugese and Quenya in the list.) Again, the game might crash on the first try.

## macOS support

There is currently no pre-built version of Caxton available for macOS, so if you're using macOS, you'll have to build it yourself [from source](https://gitlab.com/Kyarei/caxton).
