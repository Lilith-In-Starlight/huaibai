# Hủaıbaı

A [Toaq](https://toaq.net/) translation of Minecraft.

You may retrieve the pack by [downloading a ZIP archive of the repository](https://github.com/toaq/huaibai/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or by `git clone`ing the repository (if you have access to `git`). You don't need to unpack the ZIP unless you want to make modifications.

To install, copy the repository folder/ZIP into your resource pack folder (either go to `%APPDATA%\.minecraft\resourcepacks` on Windows or `~/.minecraft/resourcepacks` on Linux, creating subdirectories as necessary, or open your game, navigate to Resource Packs, then click Open Resource Pack Folder), enable the resource pack, and then select 'Tỏaq (Tóaqgua)' from the language menu.
